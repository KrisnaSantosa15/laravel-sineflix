<p class="text-base font-thin dark:text-white dark:text-opacity-60">This Software Licensing Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legally binding contract between you (hereinafter referred to as "You" or "Licensee") and Bergside Inc. ("Licensor"). By accessing or using Flowbite Pro, including any downloadable files, HTML source code snippets, and Figma assets provided to you upon purchase (collectively, the"Software"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree with these terms, do not use the Software.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-base font-bold  dark:text-white">1. License Grant</p>
<p class="text-base font-thin dark:text-white dark:text-opacity-60">Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-base font-bold  dark:text-white">2. Licensing Option</p>
<p class="text-base font-thin dark:text-white dark:text-opacity-60">Licensor offers two licensing options:</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="text-base font-bold  dark:text-white">Standard License</p>
<br>
<p class="text-base font-thin dark:text-white dark:text-opacity-60">
The Standard License is designed for individual use and offers a versatile option for creators. While it is intended for single-user access, it serves as an excellent choice for those seeking to build an unlimited number of projects.
<br>
<br>
Whether you're developing personal websites, crafting web applications for clients, creating commercial software, or working on open-source initiatives, the Standard License provides the flexibility and tools you need to bring your ideas to life. It empowers you to utilize the download files for a wide range of projects, making it an ideal choice for individual developers and small teams.
<br>
<br>
<ul class="dark:text-opacity-60 space-y-1 list-disc px-6 dark:text-white">
    <li>
        This license grants permission to one individual (the Licensee) to access and use the download files.
    </li>
    <li>
        Examples of allowed usage include creating personal websites, web applications for clients, commercial SaaS applications, self-hosted web applications, and open-source projects where the primary purpose is not redistributing download files.
    </li>
    <li>
        Examples of disallowed usage include creating repositories of Flowbite Pro elements for public distribution, developing alternative versions of Flowbite Pro, and creating website builder projects that can be considered as direct competitors of Flowbite Pro.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="text-base font-bold  dark:text-white">Team License</p>
<br>
<p class="text-base font-thin dark:text-white dark:text-opacity-60">
This license extends permission to up to ten (10) Employees and Contractors of the Licensee's organization to access and use the download files. Usage by additional team members beyond this limit requires a separate licensing agreement (ie. a new purchase of a Team License) or an appropriate upgrade.
<br>
<br>
This license grants the same permissions and restrictions as the Standard License, with the added benefit of accommodating larger teams within the specified limit. The same usage examples and prohibitions as outlined in the Standard License apply.
<br>
<br>
Please ensure that your organization adheres to the specified team member limit. If you require licensing for more than ten team members, please contact us for further licensing options.
